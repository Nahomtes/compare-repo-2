              The PMTL as published by the FDA is optimized for
              human-readability. This presents several computational challenges
              for integration into the Molecular Targets Platform. To overcome
              these challenges and make the PMTL compatible with the Molecular

              required.

              symbol). As published, the FDA PMTL does not use a standardized,
              computable naming system. In addition, many FDA PMTL targets are
              representations of complex proteins or pathways, each consisting
              of a multitude of genes (e.g. “Proteasome”, “Tubulins” or “Hippo

              targets, which enabled mapping each target to Ensembl gene IDs.
              Original FDA-curated citations within the PMTL were used to guide
              this process.

              Targets will appear once for each FDA Target. For example, BRAF is
              derived from three separate FDA Targets: “BRAF | Gene Abnormality:
              BRAF”, “ERK | Gene Abnormality: BRAF, MAP2K1”, and “MEK | Gene
              Abnormality: BRAF and BRAF gene fusions, MAP2K1, NF1”. Searching
              the Target Symbol column for “BRAF” on the {fdaPmtlPage.label} will show
