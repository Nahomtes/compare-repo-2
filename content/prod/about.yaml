      paragraph: "NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD) charged the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) to build the Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC), a cloud-based repository of spontaneously-arising canine cancer data. ICDC was established to further research on human cancers by enabling comparative analysis with canine cancer. The data in the ICDC is sourced from multiple different programs and projects; all focused on canine subjects. The data is harmonized into an integrated data model and then made available to the research community. The ICDC is part of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC), an initiative from NCI’s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT). Bioinformatic analysis of the ICDC data is accomplished using the CRDC’s $$[Cloud Resources](target:_self url:/#/crdc type:0)$$."

      paragraph: "Within the FNLCR, the Biomedical Informatics and Data Science (BIDS) Directorate is focused on software engineering and data science. The Applied and Developmental Research Directorate (ADRD) is managing the ICDC Steering Committee and providing one of the data sources for the ICDC. Finally, there is also an ICDC Steering Committee (composed of external members, FNLCR and NCI staff) that provides advice to DCTD on the ICDC."
